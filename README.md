# MCU Image Packer

Drag and drop an image file onto this app's window to encode images as bitmaps that can be drawn onto a variety of microcontroller-driven displays (e.g., LED matrices, OLED displays).

This app was written to support the use of [Adafruit's GFX Graphics Library's `drawBitmap` function](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/graphics-primitives#bitmaps-2002806).

## To do

- exception handling
- input file validation
- handle a directory of images
